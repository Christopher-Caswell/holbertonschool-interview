# The goal:

>> Write a function that computes the sum of two sandpiles
>
>> You can assume that both grid1 and grid2 are individually stable
>> A sandpile is considered stable when none of its cells contains more than 3 grains
>> When your function is done, grid1 must be stable
>> grid1 must be printed before each toppling round, only if it is unstable
>> Youâ€™re not allowed to allocate memory dynamically
