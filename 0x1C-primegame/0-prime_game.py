    Maria and Ben are playing a game. Given a set of consecutive integers starting from 1 up to and including n, they take turns choosing a prime number from the set and removing that number and its multiples from the set. The player that cannot make a move loses the game.

    They play x rounds of the game, where n may be different for each round. Assuming Maria always goes first and both players play optimally, determine who the winner of each game is.

    Prototype: def isWinner(x, nums)
    where x is the number of rounds and nums is an array of n
    Return: name of the player that won the most rounds
    If the winner cannot be determined, return None
    You can assume n and x will not be larger than 10000
