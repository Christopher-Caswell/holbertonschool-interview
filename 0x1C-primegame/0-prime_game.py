    Maria and Ben are playing a game.
    Given a set of consecutive integers
    starting from 1 up to and including n,
    they take turns choosing a prime number
    from the set and removing that number and
    its multiples from the set. The player
    that cannot make a move loses the game.

    They play x rounds of the game, where n
    may be different for each round.
    Assuming Maria always goes first and
    both players play optimally, determine
    who the winner of each game is.

    Prototype: def isWinner(x, nums)

    Return: name of the player that won the most rounds
    If the winner cannot be determined, return None
