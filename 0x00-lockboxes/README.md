# The task is thus, if you dare to undertake it:

# You have n number of locked boxes in front of you. Each box is numbered sequentially from 0 to n - 1 and each box may contain keys to the other boxes.

## Write a method that determines if all the boxes can be opened.

> Prototype: def canUnlockAll(boxes) /n
> boxes is a list of lists /n
> A key with the same number as a box opens that box /n
> You can assume all keys will be positive integers /n
> There can be keys that do not have boxes /n
> The first box boxes[0] is unlocked /n
> Return True if all boxes can be opened, else return False /n
